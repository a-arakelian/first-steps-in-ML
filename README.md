> **WARNING:** The first difficulty I encountered was the inability of the git system to cope with a large number of files (~ 70k). Therefore, I  had to add the data set to .gitignore. However, these files are small in size and therefore their archiving options can be downloaded from the dropbox. A manual is written separately for each specific case.

## Handwritten digit recognition
As an introduction to the task, I offer the [following](https://youtu.be/aircAruvnKk) super beautiful video

The handwritten digit recognition program is a kind of "Hello World" program in the case of deep learning. Although on this task I try (almost) the entire arsenal of machine learning, not limited only to neural networks. To fully familiarize yourself with this project, you can go to the directory [`handwritten_digit_recognition`](https://github.com/a-arakelian/first-steps-in-ML/tree/main/handwritten_digit_recognition)
